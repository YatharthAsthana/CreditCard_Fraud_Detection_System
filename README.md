# CreditCard_Fraud_Detection_System
With online payments and credit card usage on the rise, the risk of fraudulent transactions has increased. Fraud causes financial institutions to lose money and harms customer trust and operational efficiency. Quickly detecting fraudulent transactions is essential for maintaining system integrity and ensuring smooth payment operations.
This project addresses these issues by using Pycaret, a low-code Machine Learning library, to build a robust and scalable fraud detection system. The dataset used contains transactions labeled as legitimate or fraudulent. Key features include transaction amount, time, and various anonymized variables. Pre-processing in this project involves handling null values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance. Fraud detection typically involves imbalanced datasets, as fraudulent transactions are rare. Relevant features were engineered to reflect transaction patterns, such as average transaction amount, time gaps between transactions, and frequency of high-value transactions. These features align closely with operational metrics used in financial risk assessment and compliance.
In the beginning, I modeled the system using Isolation Forest and OneClassSVM techniques. These techniques gave phenomenal results, reaching an accuracy of 98%. Although these techniques worked out, I decided to enhance the working and applicability of the project by inculcating pycaret. It is an open-source, low-code ML library in Python that helps you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within minutes. Moreover, it increases productivity and it's easy to use. It allows comparing different models and choosing one model among multiple ML models, based on key evaluation metrics like AUC-ROC and F1-score.
Random Forest Model was identified as the best-performing model with high accuracy and precision, crucial for reducing false positives. The model gave impressive results by providing an accuracy of 99.5%. To further optimize the model, I performed hyperparameter tuning, enhancing its sensitivity and recall. This step ensured the model's ability to detect fraudulent activities without compromising operational efficiency and enhanced the accuracy to 99.95%.
Pycaret's deployment-ready features enable it to be exported as a pickle file, making it easy to integrate into payment processing systems for real-time fraud detection. The system works efficiently and can play a vital role in the industry by detecting fraudulent transactions.
